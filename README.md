# Matrix Digital Rain

[Matrix digital rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain) is the computer code featured in the Matrix series. In the film, the code that comprises the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters.

I use the Japanese katakana alphabet and Latin alphabet and numerals.
